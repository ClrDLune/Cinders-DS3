# NPCs
- Yuria, Yoel, Greirat, Karla, Cornyx, Orbeck, Irina, Andre now operate in the same manner as the custom merchants. This means they will respawn if killed.
- Changed the trigger for Yuria to only require Draw Out Strength maximum from Yoel.
- Yuria will no longer leave once she is present in the shrine.
- Yoel will now only die once Yuria is triggered.
- Greirat can pillage, but won't disappear from the Shrine during this period.
- Orbeck will no longer leave once he is present in the shrine.

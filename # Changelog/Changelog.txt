# Spell Tools
- Re-IDed the spell tool entries, which means old saves will have broken items.
- Removed the damage affinity mechanic.
- Removed Chaos Flame
- Removed Abyssal Flame
- Removed Fool's Flame
- Removed Jester's Talisman
- Re-added the softcap curve for spell buff so power growth is more consistent from the start.
- Hex catalysts have an earlier softcap curve since they need to invest in split stats.
- Pyromancy catalysts require no stats for their growth, just reinforcement, but overall spell buff for them is lower than the other schools.
- Hybrid catalysts are no longer infusable. However they are now stronger than their previous baseline to account for this.
- Only Hex catalysts have the ability to cast multiple schools. And for the non-Hex schools, it is at 50% effectiveness.
- Added Fool's Catalyst: can cast all schools but has a fixed spell buff of 100, although spell damage itself still scales with Luck (250 spell buff equivalent). Uses Rubbish to reinforce. Dropped by Fester the Jester.

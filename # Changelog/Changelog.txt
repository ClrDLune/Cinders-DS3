# Changelog
#------------------------------
# Mechanics
- Re-added the Deathless Run reward. If you kill the Soul of Cinder without having died once from the start of the game, you can visit Magnum Ursus and claim the Relic of Power.
- Added a Hitless Run reward. If you kill the Soul of Cinder without having taken damage from enemies once from the start of the game, you can visit Magnum Ursus and claim the Relic of Insanity.
- Rolling multiple times within a short period now costs more. After the first roll, the cost is +5, capping at +30 after 6 rolls.
- Removed the Devastating Blow mechanic.

# Menus
- You can now toggle your Pledge of Loyalty to Rosaria.
- Moved Marks to the Accursed Altar.
- Added Divorce option for NPCs you have married. Returns the Ring of Betrothal.

# Enemy Revival
- Re-themed the Memory items to Tomes.
- You now purchase the tomes from Magnum Ursus in Firelink Shrine. They are consumable and cost 10% of the bosses base soul reward. You can purchase multiple.
- Each tome appears once you have defeated its boss for the first time.
- Blood of Might is now Tome: Champions of Yore.
- Tomes are no longer removed in NG+, but will only work once the boss has been killed in that journey atleast once.

# Weapons
- Reduced the damage of the pistol sidearms.

# Armor
- Adjusted the effect design. Now the head pieces are the only pieces with effects. This means the effects will be stronger in most cases, but there is now natural exclusivity.
- Changed Winged Helm of Ridoh effect: attacking will eventually restore estus.

# Infusions
- Fire infusion is now more of a psuedo-Raw infusion. It removes all scaling, but the base damage for Fire is much higher than normal. This is to bring it into line with the new design for Pyromancies, and to make it distinct from the Dark infusion.

- Removed the damage affinity mechanic.
- Removed Chaos Flame
- Removed Abyssal Flame

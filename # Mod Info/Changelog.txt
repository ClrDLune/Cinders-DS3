# Changelog
#------------------------------

# Items
- Removed Ashen Estus Flask.
- Added Focus Implement. This is found in the same location as the Ashen Estus Flask. This makes you enter a focusing stance for several seconds, after which you restore FP. This is unlimited and can be used whenever, however you cannot cancel out of it, so it is dangerous to do whilst in active combat.
- Reduced the max Estus Flask count to 10, since they no longer need to be split between Normal and Ashen.

# Rings
- Ashen Estus Ring is now Focusing Ring: boosts FP restoration by 100% using the Focus Implement.

# Menu
- Removed the Allot Estus menu option (no longer needed).
- Removed Andre's check on holding the Ashen Estus Flask.

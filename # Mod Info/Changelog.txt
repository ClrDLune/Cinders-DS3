# Poise
- Adjusted poise health. Poise health is restored with weapon swings. The overall poise health is the same across all animations (40). This value has been chosen to allow poise to consistently block small to mid strength enemy attacks if you swing after being hit, but allow for more powerful attacks to stagger unless you have a very optimised poise % setup.

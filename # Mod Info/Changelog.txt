# Changelog
#------------------------------
# Mechanics
- Changed FP design back to vanilla amounts.
- FP sources still work the same way, but give 1 FP per second in most cases.
- Reduced the duration of the rolling stamina increases so it doesn't linger beyond normal panic rolling.
- Moved the Affix mechanic to enchanting table position. Now available in NG0.
- Adjusted base enemy scaling and base NG+ scaling to match vanilla. The corrections are still higher.
- Restored vanilla softcap correction graph.
- Restored the vanilla stat contribution graphs for resists and defences.

# Curses/Marks
- Re-added the Curse of Attraction for the additional enemy toggle.
- Removed Marks.

# Weapons
- Sidearms cost durability instead of FP.
- Primordial Reinforcement now only needs Primordial Essence (3/6/9/12/15 cost).

# Armor
- Increased poise health.
- Restored the old armor effect design.
- Removed Enchantment system.

# Items
- Reverted the Estus Flask animation slowdown.
- Estus Flask sip now pauses stamina regen and poise.
- Added illusionary insignia/emblems for all armor sets. Sold by Alchemist Jiji. They allow you to override your head/armor apperance with another set's appearance.
- Renamed Time-list Essence to Primordial Essence.
- Primordial Essence is dropped by bosses that are considered 'tough'.

# Spells
- Adjusted FP to vanilla FP design.
- Lingering Chaos now throws one orb.
- Bursting Fireball now shares hits between fireballs. This means it is more of an AOE spell, as a single target will only be harmed by 1 of the fireballs.

# Changelog

# Enchantments
- HP Regen
Base Effect: restores 2 HP per second.
Attuned Effect: restores 4 HP per second.
   
- FP Regen
Base Effect: restores 0.5% FP per second. Now paused like other FP regen.
Attuned Effect: restores 1% FP per second. Now paused like other FP regen.

# Mechanics
- Reduced the duration of the rolling stamina increases so it doesn't linger beyond normal panic rolling.

# Items
- Reverted the Estus Flask animation slowdown.
- Estus Flask sip now pauses stamina regen and poise.
- Estus Flask drink animation now doubles damage taken if you are hit during it.

# Spells
- Lingering Chaos now throws one orb. FP cost is now 200, damage is now 250.
- Bursting Fireball now shares hits between fireballs. This means it is more of an AOE spell, as a single target will only be harmed by 1 of the fireballs.

# Bugfixes
- Fixed Huntmaster Ava's AI not being loaded.
